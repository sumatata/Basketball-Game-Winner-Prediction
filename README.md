# Predicting Basketball Game Winners Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of basketball games based on player and team statistics. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using various ML algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `parse_data.ipynb`: Parses and prepares the raw basketball game and player stats data.
- `predict.ipynb`: Baseline model pipeline and feature exploration.
- `Predict-Lasso.ipynb`: Lasso regression model implementation for feature selection and prediction.
- `predict-random-forest.ipynb`: Random Forest classifier implementation for prediction tasks.
